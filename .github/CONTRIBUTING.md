# Contributing to CheeseBot

:+1::tada: Thank you for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to CheeseBot. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.


## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [cultofcheese@block2block.me](mailto:cultofcheese@block2block.me).

## I don't want to read this whole thing I just have a question!!!

Please join the Discord. Please do not file an issue for a question.

## What should I know before I get started?

The bot is purpose built for the Cult of Cheese Discord. The bot was not designed for use by other Discord, although I have tried my best to make it as adaptable as possible. If there are any glaring issues, please create a GitHub issue and I will do my best to fix it.

The bot uses the Discord.JS library for its functionality and is written natively in Node.js. The bot uses the youtube-dl executable and a JS wrapper for it, as well as FFMPEG. Please ensure you have these installed before writing any bug reports.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for the bot. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report :pencil:, reproduce the behavior :computer: :computer:, and find related reports :mag_right:.

Before creating bug reports, please check [this list](#before-submitting-a-bug-report) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report). Fill out the required template, the information it asks for helps us resolve issues faster.

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

#### Before Submitting A Bug Report

**Before submitting a bug report, please perform a [cursory search](https://github.com/search?q=+is%3Aissue+user%3ABlock2Block)** to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has **and the issue is still open**, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). Create an issue and provide the following information by filling in the template.

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. For example, when using a command, what channel was it in? What was the bot doing at the time?
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
* **If you're reporting that the bot crashed**, include a crash report with a stack trace from the operating system. Include the crash report in the issue in a [code block](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines), a [file attachment](https://help.github.com/articles/file-attachments-on-issues-and-pull-requests/), or put it in a [gist](https://gist.github.com/) and provide link to that gist.

Provide more context by answering these questions:

* **Did the problem start happening recently** (e.g. after updating to a new version of the bot) or was this always a problem?
* **Can you reliably reproduce the issue?** If not, provide details about how often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens.

Include details about your configuration and environment:

* **Which version of the bot are you using?** You can get the exact version by running `git show` in your terminal and copying the long hash number it gives you.
* **What's the name and version of the OS you're using**?
* **What Node.js and npm version are you using?** You can find the version by running `node -v` and `npm -v`.

### Suggesting Enhancements

Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your suggestion :pencil: and find related suggestions :mag_right:.

When you are creating an enhancement suggestion, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-enhancement-suggestion). Fill in the template, including the steps that you imagine you would take if the feature you're requesting existed.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). Create an issue on that and provide the following information:

### Pull Requests

If you want to submit a pull request, please ensure that it follows the same kind of formatting as the rest of the bot. Any that do not follow the same rough idea will be instantly rejected.
We would love to implement all pull requests, but as this will be being put onto a public bot, all of them will be heavily reviewed and we reserve the right to reject any that we do not feel is up to standard.
Please ensure you follow the format.
